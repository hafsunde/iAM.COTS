\title{Combine an estimate matrix and an SE matrix into long format}
\usage{
combine_SE(M, SE)
}
\arguments{
\item{M}{A numeric matrix of estimates.}

\item{SE}{A numeric matrix of standard errors. Must have the same dimensions
as M.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with columns:
\itemize{
\item Row: row name (or row index if rownames are missing)
\item Col: column name (or column index if colnames are missing)
\item Estimate: the estimate for the cell
\item SE: the standard error for the cell
}
}
\description{
Converts a matrix of estimates and a matrix of standard errors of the same
dimension into a long data.frame with one row per cell.
}
\details{
If rownames(M) or colnames(M) are NULL, they are replaced by character
versions of the corresponding indices (1..nrow, 1..ncol).

This function does not check that SE is conformable beyond relying on
as.vector() recycling rules; mismatched dimensions will silently produce
wrong results. Prefer to add an explicit dimension check if this becomes
user-facing.
