\title{Plot iAM-COTS variance and parent-offspring decomposition results}
\usage{
iamcots.plot(fit, sim_vars = NULL, sim_PO = NULL, incl.sort = T, boot.CI = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{A fitted OpenMx model (typically returned by iam.cots.fun) that
contains est_var and est_PO results.}

\item{sim_vars}{Optional simulated variance-component results to overlay.
Must be compatible with get.varcomps(), which expects it to be coercible
via t(sim_vars) and to align with est_var column names.}

\item{sim_PO}{Optional simulated parent-offspring decomposition results to
overlay. Must be compatible with get.POcor(), i.e., contain columns
parameter, type, and estimate.}

\item{incl.sort}{Logical. If TRUE, include the sorting-factor variance
decomposition panel.}

\item{boot.CI}{Logical. If TRUE and fit$compute is an MxComputeBootstrap
object, use bootstrap quantile intervals instead of Wald-type intervals.}
}
\value{
A grob object returned by gridExtra::grid.arrange().
}
\description{
Creates a multi-panel summary plot for a fitted iAM-COTS OpenMx model.
Panels include (1) variance decomposition for the parental phenotype,
(2) decomposition of the parent-offspring correlation into components,
(3) variance decomposition for the offspring phenotype, and optionally
(4) variance decomposition for the parental sorting factor.
}
\details{
Uncertainty is shown using confidence intervals when available. If the fit
contains OpenMx confidence intervals, those are used. Otherwise Wald-type
intervals are computed from standard errors, or bootstrap quantile intervals
can be used when the model was fitted with MxComputeBootstrap.

If simulated values are provided, they are overlaid as additional points
on the relevant panels.

This function depends on ggplot2 and gridExtra. It also assumes the following
functions exist in the package namespace: get.POcor(), get.varcomps(), and
custom_theme(). The plotted parameters are hard-coded to specific est_var
and est_PO labels produced by the iAM-COTS model.
